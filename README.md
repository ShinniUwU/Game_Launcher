Hello! This is a game launcher written in Python. It uses the pickle module to create a text file called "games.p" which stores a list of game names and their directories in your Documents (note: the code is already compiled into a single .exe file, located in the "dist" folder).

With this script, you can easily launch your games from a central location and hide them from friends when sharing your screen. Plus, it's a neat and organized way to access your games.

One feature that is currently missing is the ability to close the launcher after launching a game. If you would like to use this script, please feel free to do so. But don't forget to give credit where credit is due!
